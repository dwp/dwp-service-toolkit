**"A small piece of interaction that can be used on its own or part of a bigger thing"**


Thoughts:

- A selection of styles that make UI (HTML/CSS/JS produces this for dev)
- Contained
- Composable
- Single purpose UI that can be composed
- stand alone / self contained
- Agnostic of it's context/context
