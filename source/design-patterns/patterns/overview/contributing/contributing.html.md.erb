# Contributing

You can contribute to this by opening a [pull request]().

We currently have the following templates for a [pattern]() and [component]().

We also have a [trello]() and [slack]() channel you can join for guidance and to help track progress.

These are written in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
